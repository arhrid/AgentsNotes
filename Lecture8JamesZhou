## Virtual Lab
Interdisciplinary AI scientists that work with human scientists on challenging, open-ended
research

Agent Creation (ex. GPT-4o as the base model)
Team meeting (agents can have group meetings or 1 on 1 meetings for subtasks)
Individual meeting (tools in sandbox environment)


Principal Investigator (PI), Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist,
Scientific Critic
All group members discuss 

Antibodies are commonly used as binders under many pharma and biotech companies.
Nanobodies only found in a few animals like camels. (cousins of antibodies)

Virtual Lab has increased efficiency due to having parallel meetings.
Agents can discuss 5x in paralled. PI takes transcipt of all meetings for summary.

Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic, Principal Investigator
Computational Biologist (28.1%): Does most of talking -> come up with plan for designing nanobodies
Scientific Critic (26.2%):
Principal Investigator(20.9%):
Machine Learning Specialist(17.7%): Do all coding for other agents, implements algorithms in Python or other languages 
Immunologist(5.9%): 
Human Researcher(1.3%): Don't talk too much; provide high-level guidance (ex. create binders, money constraints)


## Virtual Lab School of self-improving AI scientist
1.Choose Topics for Agents
2.Self Generate Queries
3.Search PMC & Select Papers

Go to PubMed, download article, read articles, SFT to update model parameters, 
perform next-token prediction, testing mechanism ...,
Then teacher agents generate quizzes to see how student agents perform. 

Start with o1 for an agent. Agents become more specialized through task progression.

### Ex. Virtual Lab designs nanobodies for recent COVID Variants
Agents pass 3d structure from AlphaFold into Rosetta (physics model)

Agents are able to rapidly reduce design space in to 92 nanobody candidates for binders.

 Graphs show enchanced binding. 
Bottom Red curve: Recent Human-denerated nanobody, with JN.1
Red curve: Virtual Lab designed new nanobody ..
Two blue curves (Wuhan RBD)
Two red curves (JN.1 RBD)

Learnings: Multiple agents w/ diverse expertise better than single agent
Helpful to provide agent with memory and sandbox to safely execute tools

## Paper2Agent
Difficult for humans to gather best insights from a paper...
For papers that involve code, tough for non-experts to understanding main points of paper.

So PaperAgent can help readers/users to implement methods of paper into their own papers.


Scanpy agent
User: Perform standard quality control on my single-cell data:
data.h5ad
Agent generates analysis. Human experts also analyze same datasets & figures.

Google DeepMind released AlphaGenome (find mutations in genome)
Look for causal genes associated with LDL cholesterol.

### Agent-agent collaboration -> new discoveries 
Agents can collaborate and generate new insights. 
No need for human authors to setup meeting and send emails together.

ADHD agents & AlphaGenome Agent collaborated to find new splicing error associated with ADHD risk
ADHD GWAS paper

Discussion: Easier for readers to user the methods + data from the paper
since Paper2Agent converts passive papers into interactive agents

## Open Conference of AI Agents for Science 2025
How creative are AI scientist agents?
How should human researchers collaborate with AI agents?
How good are LLMs at reviewing papers?

LLMs and agents that people used:
Peopel used Claude, gPT-4/5, Gemini,
DeepResearch(OpenAI), ClaudeCode, Qwen, KIMI-K2, Deepsekk-V3

Mostly AI with some human inolvement
For Accepted papers (more human inolvement) compared to papers from general submissions

More human involvement in hypothesisd evelopment & experimental design

More reliance on AI for data analysis and writing

GPT-5 most conservative reviewer. (lowest scores assigned to paper)
Gemini is the most positive reviewer (higher scores assigned to paper)
Claude Sonnet most balanced reviewer.

There is an Automated Reference Verification through usage of an 
AI Agent. If references can't be verified, users will see warning on OpenReview.

Interesting example of Agentic Science Conference
Simulating Two-sided Job Marketplaces with AI Agents

Agent based modelling of the two-sided market places is an interesting topic according to economics nobel researcher
